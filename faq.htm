<p><span class="strong">What does SaaS stand for?</span>
</p>
<p>SaaS stands for “Software as a Service.” The idea of SaaS is that you don’t purchase hardware and software and run them in-house. Instead, you contract with a company equipped with its own server farm, software and support Staff. Your users then access those applications across the Internet.
</p>
<p><span class="strong">What are the benefits of SaaS comparing to SW license provisioning?</span>
</p>
<p>SaaS has the advantage of providing VanillaDesk to small and medium-size businesses without forcing them to incur large investments in hardware infrastructure, Staff and application design and programming. Instead of facing large upfront costs, the Customer pays for access to VanillaDesk on a regular basis, much like a phone bill.
</p>
<p><span class="strong">What does ITIL<sup>&reg;</sup></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"></span><span class="strong"> stand for?</span>
</p>
<p>A descriptive framework of best practices for the delivery of IT services also known as IT Service Management (ITSM). The IT Infrastructure Library provides a source of guidance on what an IT organization needs to think about in order to deliver and directly support IT services.
</p>
<p><span class="strong">What do I need to install locally?</span>
</p>
<p>No local application is required. A standard internet browser and appropriate internet connection is all you need to use the VanillaDesk solution. It is a 100% web-based solution.
</p>
<p><span class="strong">How can I save money with VanillaDesk SaaS solution?</span>
</p>
<p>Traditional solutions require a lot of side investments:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>hardware to run on,&nbsp;</li>
  <li>correct network configuration,</li>
  <li>client software to be installed,</li>
  <li>upgrade and reconfiguration charges</li>
  <li>surcharges to increase the number of available user licences</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>VanillaDesk has no additional costs involved.

<p class="bigbold"><a id="security" name="security" title="security" class="anchor"></a>Security &amp; Reliability
  <br>
</p>
<p><span class="strong">How secure is my data?</span>
</p>
<p>We understand that cloud based solutions may be seen as less secure in compare to „localy installed“ systems. So we implemented some measures to make you more comfortable:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Nobody, not even our support team is able to log in to your instance without having an account there.</li>
  <li>Each customer has his own database, which is totally isolated from the other databases.
  <br></li>
  <li>We do not store your passwords, so you can not retrieve it from our system. Our password recovery procedure allows you only to <em>reset</em> your password.</li>
  <li>All our servers are running in Amazon AWS datacenters, so physical security is undisputable (see here for more details <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/security" target="_blank" title="Amazon AWS Security">http://aws.amazon.com/security</a>).</li>
  <li>We use SSL encryption to protect your data while being transferred over Internet.</li>
</ul><span class="strong">How reliable is VanillaDesk infrastructure?</span>
<p>Reliability is our second top concern.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Our application servers are <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/#features" target="_blank">load-balanced and auto-scaled</a> which provides automated failover.
  <br></li>
  <li>Our databases are clustered with automated failovers. Cluster nodes are spread in multiple datacenter locations (<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/" target="_blank">AWS Availability Zones</a>).</li>
  <li>Data are automatically backed-up to Amazon S3 systems (just in case ALL cluster nodes would fail).</li>
</ul>
