    When a ticket gets updated in VanillaDesk, notifications are automatically dispatched to people who may be interested in the performed activity. There was, however, no way to see who were the notifications sent to and whether they were actually sent. By introducing the overview of sent notifications for each ticket activity, there is now the possibility to view all notifications, that were triggered by performing a ticket update.
