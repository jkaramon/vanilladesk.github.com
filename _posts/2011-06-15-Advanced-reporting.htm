<p><strong>It's easier now to see what is going on in VanillaDesk</strong>
</p>
<p>We introduced new reporting capabilities to help you oversee the functioning of your service desk. Use the new SLA and worklog reports to improve its processes.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="strong">&nbsp;SLA reports</span> - allow tracking the availability of your services, mean time between failures, and any breaches to the agreed conditions.</li>
  <li><span class="strong">&nbsp;Worklog reports</span> - evaluate the effort spent to resolve tickets, manage overtimes and more...</li>
</ul>
<p>The interface has also been enhanced. Multiple outputs for each report, new filtering and grouping options are only some of the new features.
