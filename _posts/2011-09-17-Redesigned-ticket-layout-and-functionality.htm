<p>The original ticket design and functionality were a bit outdated - redesign was necessary. The new design is simpler, all important info is placed where it is needed and the ticket updating system is also much more intuitive.
</p>
<p>These are the things we improved:
</p>
<p><span class="strong">Ticket view mode</span> - each ticket is displayed in what we call a "View mode". The view mode is easier to read, displays all information for you might need right where you can see it. It no longer allows editing the ticket.
</p>
<p><span class="strong">Ticket edit mode</span> - the oposite of the <em>view mode</em> is the <em>edit mode</em>. It is triggered every time you need to change a key part of a ticket, such as its subject or description. As these are not changed often, there is no need for them to be changable all the time.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>To fully support the new concept, we also introduced the <span class="strong">perform action panel</span>. This feature is available on all tickets allows you to make quick, repetitive updates to a ticket as simple as typing an email.&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding a comment, assigning or resolving tickets can now be done in just a few clicks.
</p>
<p>This allowed us to introduce a lot of minor changes. Better attachment handling, displaying times also in relative form (like "one minute ago"), to name just a few.&nbsp;
