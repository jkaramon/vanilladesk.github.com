<p><strong>Finally&nbsp;it is possible to give your VanillaDesk notifications&nbsp;nicer design.</strong>
</p>
<p>May&nbsp;release introduces&nbsp;"<em>wiki-like</em>" markdown syntax + customized CSS styling so you can create notifications, which are much easier to read and understand by the recipients.
</p>
<p>Supported formatting includes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>custom colors</li>
  <li>bold, italic, underlined font types</li>
  <li>block quotes</li>
  <li>headers</li>
  <li>lists</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, not&nbsp;completely&nbsp;our invention - we have implemented markdown from Daring Fireball. For detailed information about all possibilities see <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax"><u><font color="#0000ff">http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax</font></u></a>
</p>
<p>There are some exceptions which are not supported for e.g. security reasons, e.g. inline HTML. We simply want to keep VanillaDesk usage safe. We hope you'll understand.
