---
  <p>
    We are excited to announce our latest product addition, VanillaDesk Release Management. 
    As we designed this feature, we want to provide you a powerful, but easy to use tool to manage your deliveries.
  </p>

  <h3>Our release management should give the answer to these problems:</h3>
  <p>
    <h4>In which release (delivery) is the ticket fixed?</h4> 
    It is possible to define a release on ticket detail and conversely add ticket to the specific release.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h4>For whom is the release deployed?</h4> 
    A release can be assigned to one customer, to one or more customer groups, or to all customers.
  </p>

  <p>
    <h4>How to distribute software release deliveries (documents, sw packages, ...)?</h4>
    A release deliveries may be distributed via optional Microsoft SkyDrive integration. A deployed release
    is visible on customer portal. End user may see public release notes and public deliveries from specific 
    SkyDrive folder.
