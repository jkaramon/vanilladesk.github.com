		Are you tired of browsing through countless manual pages of a software you just started using? This is not the case with VanillaDesk. Our Help is right where it should be – only inches away from the functionality you need to help with.
	</p>
	<p>
		We understand, that no one has the time to look for explanations of functionality in manuals, that can be hundreds of pages long. Additionally, searching for this info for a long period of time, makes you forget what you were looking for in the first place.
	</p>
	<p>
    All VanillaDesk functionality, that needs explaining or that can be confusing at first, has its own contextual help. 
    Whenever you are not sure how a part of VanillaDesk works, 
    look for the nearest&nbsp;<img src="{% news_img_url help.png %}" alt="help">&nbsp;icon. Clicking it will open a window with all explanations.
	</p>
	<p>
    As you can see below, the <img src="{% news_img_url help.png %}" alt="help">&nbsp; icons can be found all over VanillaDesk.
	</p>

	</p>
	<p>
    The contextual help also offers lots of useful tips and examples on how to setup and use VanillaDesk.

		The help content is updated daily, but of course, if you find, that a functionality is not explained in a clearly understandable manner, do not hesitate and ask us directly at <a href="mailto:support@vanilladesk.com" target="" title="" onclick="">support@vanilladesk.com</a> and we will be happy to assist you.
