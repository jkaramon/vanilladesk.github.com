    We announce a new addition in our latest product version, VanillaDesk Knowledge Base Management.
    As we designed this feature, we want to provide you a standardized way to resolve common incidents.
  </p>

  <h3>Our knowledge base should extend your working processes:</h3>
  <p>
    <h4>Close call with an existing article</h4>
    It is possible to link a call to exiting KB article without creating an incident.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h4>Create KB article from existing ticket</h4>
    All problems and incidents can be converted into KB article using predefined template.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h4>Operator suggestions</h4>
    While working with ticket, the operator has a new suggestions sidebar at disposal. The suggested
    tickets and articles can help with ticket resolution or finding similarities.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h4>Portal extensions</h4>
    All published articles are available in the customer portal now. During ticket creation in portal,
    the end users get related KB articles suggestions which can be useful before ticket creation.
