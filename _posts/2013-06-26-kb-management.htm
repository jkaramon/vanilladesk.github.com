  <p>
    We announce a re-implementation of Knowledge Base (KB) in our latest product version.
  </p>

  <h3>This new simple but cool feature can help you as follow:</h3>
  <p>
    <h4>Suggestions</h4>
    KB articles appear in the list of suggested tickets/articles which our system finds relevant
    for the ticket operator is working on.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h4>Close a call by relating it to an existing article</h4>
    It is possible to link a call to an exiting KB article without creating an incident.
    This can be e.g. used for know-errors or very often repeating issues.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h4>Create KB article from an existing ticket</h4>
    All problems and incidents can be converted into KB article using predefined template.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h4>Portal extensions</h4>
    All published articles are available in the customer portal too. End users will be provided with
    suggestions for KB articles which might be relevant for their issue while creating a ticket through
    the customer portal.
