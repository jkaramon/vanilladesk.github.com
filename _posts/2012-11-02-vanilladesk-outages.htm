  We experienced a series of short outages of our service on Wednesday October 31st, 2012 from 7:30pm UTC till approximately 10pm UTC.

<p>
  We located a serious issue which caused infinite notification loops resulting in unacceptable application response times and even application outages. 
  A workaround has been applied on Wednesday and final fixe has been delivered yesterday.

  We thank you for your patience and apologize for any inconvenience.
