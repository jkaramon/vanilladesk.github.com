summary:  You can now send notifications to your customers and users in their own language.

<p>
If you supply your services to customers in multiple countries, it may not always be appropriate to use English for comunication.<br />
Now, you can define notifications for each language your customers use and VanillaDesk will send the correct version to selected customers. 
</p>

<table style="border-image: none; width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; text-align:justify;" frame="void" rules="none" border="0" cellpadding="5"><tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>{% news_img notificationLanguages02.PNG %}</td>
      <td>
	<p>
	You are able to define a list of languages in the Notification settings that you wish to use.
	</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p>
        In a <b>notification template</b>, a tab will be created for each language. <br />Simply define what the notification should look like in the particular language.
        </p>
        <p>
        We understand, that configuring templates to your liking will take some time, therefore each language within a template can be activated once you are finished with it.
        </p>

        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

        Additionally, each <b>Operator</b> can select which language he wants to receive notifications in.
