<p><strong>Everything can get better and especially software and service! </strong>
</p>
<p>Following this (and your feedback) we spent last weeks enhancing VanillaDesk so we can serve you better. So this is what we have been working on:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><u>Email integration and notification system</u> – according to your feedback, this was the weakest area. And obviously you were right. So we focused our efforts here. Enhancements will allow you to more precisely configure when and what will be sent as notification and e.g. better management of notification templates. 
  <br /></li>
  <li><u>Better customer portal customization</u> – we have added more ways how you can customize your customer portal, so it might look like YOUR portal.
  <br /></li>
  <li><u>New reporting</u> – it should be easier for you to create reports you need. <strong>AND</strong> we have removed united reporting functionality for all Editions (well, for those which have reporting included). So now you can create your customized reports without any limitations.</li>
</ul> Enhancements mentioned above are due to come in new release in the second half of May.
