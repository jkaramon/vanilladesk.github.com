<p>
  Informing people of updates in a VanillaDesk ticket has been made easier. Here are the new features we have introduced:
</p>

<table style="border-image: none; width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; text-align:justify;" frame="void" rules="none" border="0" cellpadding="5"><tbody>
    <tr>
      <td colspan=2>
        <h5>Transforming CCs in an email into ticket watchers</h5>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan=2>
        <p>
          Have you ever sent an email to one of your customers/partners and put a lot of people in as CCs just to be aware of this communication? Now, you can create or update tickets in VanillaDesk in the same manner.
        </p> 
        <p>
          If an email, that is imported into VanillaDesk contains any CCs, the respective users or emails will be marked as watchers of the particular ticket.<br />This will ensure, that no one will be left out of the loop. 
        </p>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan=2>
        <h5>Making others watch important tickets</h5>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>      
      <td colspan=2>
        <p>
          When resolving an important ticket, you may find yourself in need of informing other operators about any progress made.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is now possible to make other people watch the ticket, bringing them into the loop.
