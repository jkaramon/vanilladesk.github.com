<p>Are our default notifications too complicated for your users or you want to adjust them for any other reason ? Now you can.
</p>
<p>All system notifications – like password reset email and more – were made customizable.
</p>
<p><span class="shadow"><a href="http://www.vanilladesk.com/files/img/news/systemnotificationsmain.png" onclick="" class="popup"><img src="http://www.vanilladesk.com/files/img/news/systemnotificationsmain.png?w=300" alt="systemnotificationsmain" class="shadow" align="left" hspace="10"></a></span> To adjust these templates, simply go to <em><strong>Manage &gt; Notifications</strong></em> and scroll down to <strong><em>System notifications.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;To preview any of them, click on their title, to adjust, click <em>Edit.</em>
</p>
<p>The system notifications are very similar to the standard notification template, so the environment is familiar (if you already adjusted them).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span class="shadow"><a href="http://www.vanilladesk.com/files/img/news/systemnotificationsedit.png" onclick="" class="popup"><img src="http://www.vanilladesk.com/files/img/news/systemnotificationsedit.png?w=400" alt="systemnotificationsedit" class="shadow" align="right" hspace="10"></a></span>There are two new features available here:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;you can always return to our predefined templates by clicking the <strong>Reset to default</strong> button <em>(this feature has also been added to the standard notification templates)</em></li>
  <li>we have <strong>highlighted the mandatory placeholders</strong>, that are necessary for the template to make sence. This will prevent any disfunctional notifications from being saved.</li>
</ul>
