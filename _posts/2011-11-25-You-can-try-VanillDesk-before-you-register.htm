</p>
<p>Are you new to VanillaDesk ? Don't know how it works ? You are now able to find out without registration. We are proud to present the demo of VanillaDesk.
</p>
<p>It is quick and there is no need for you to give away any personal data.
</p>
<p>Simply visit the <a href="/demo.htm" onclick="">Demo site</a> and request an account. You will be prompted for your name and that's it! You can start checking out how VanillaDesk works.
</p>
<p>You are free to try anything in the Demo, but bare in mind, that all Demo accounts are only temporary and no data will persist more than a day.
</p>
<p><em>Of course, you will not get the full VanillaDesk experience, as there are some technical limitations in what the Demo can show you. To see what is not available, check <a href="/demo.htm" onclick="">here</a>.</em>
