        <p>In many cases, tickets should be regularly updated, so the affected party is informed of any progress made. This task, however, becomes more difficult with higher number of tickets assigned to an Operator.</p>
        <p>We have introduced the <b>Ticket update reminder</b>. This feature will allow you to specify intervals, in which tickets need to be updated and the system dispatches emails, reminding Operators to update them.</p>

        <p>This new feature is ready to be used out-of-the-box, with only minimal setup needed.</p>

          <li>or <b>setup the update frequency</b> in the Service-level agreement (SLA). </li>
        </ul>
        <span style="font-size:80%; font-decoration:italic; color:#888;">
