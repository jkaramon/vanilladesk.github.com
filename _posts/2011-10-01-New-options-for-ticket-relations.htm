<p>Relating tickets to one another has been made easier to both internal objects and now also external systems. Additionally, not only manually created relations have been improved, but VanillaDesk can now create relations automatically based on specific criteria.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>We introduced the ability to create ticket relations using <span class="strong">drag &amp; drop</span>. When viewing a ticket, to create a relation, simply by drag a ticket from the sidebar (tickets in your inbox, your recent items) and drop it into the relations.
</p>
<p>To improve system integration, also tickets from <span class="strong">external web-based systems</span> can be linked, to help operators in the resolution.
</p>
<p>The major enhancement, however, is the<span class="strong"> automatic relation creation</span>. If you mention the ID of a ticket or another VanillaDesk object (even attachments) inside a comment, a relation to this object will automatically be created. This is particulary useful for duplicate ticket, where no complex linking is needed.
  <br />Also systems from external tickets can be automatically linked this way to decrease ticket administration and improve the resolution times a bit.
</p>
