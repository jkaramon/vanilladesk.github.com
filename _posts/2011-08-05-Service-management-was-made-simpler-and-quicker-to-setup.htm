<p><strong>Setting up service management is no longer a task everybody hates to do</strong>
</p>
<p>The arduous task of getting service management up-and-running has been made a bit easier, thanks to the new improvements in service management in VanillaDesk.
</p>
<p>Managing services and their offering to customers has been made simpler. Adding new services is a matter of seconds. Only a few simple steps are required.
</p>
<p>Same <em><strong>service level agreements</strong></em> (SLAs) can now be defined for multiple customers or even globally for all customers, allowing better scalability. This saves precious time if you offer a small number of services to a large number of customers.
</p>
<p>Another helpful change is, that now every ticket priority, defined in a SLA, can have its own calendar. This is particulary useful, if you offer a 24x7 service availability for urgent issues and only 8x5 for minor ones.
