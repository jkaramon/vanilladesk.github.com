  <p>
    It does not require too much thinking that resolved tickets and knowledge-base articles provide valuable
    source of information e.g. while solving another ticket.
    So we designed "suggestions".
  </p>

  <h3>How can Suggestions help you:</h3>
  
  <p>
    Anytime you look at the ticket (any type), system will try to analyze all existing tickets in the database
    and all existing knowledge articles and will try to list those, which might be relevant for your current 
    issue.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We are aware of the fact, that the engine evaluating relevance is "not perfect yet", but we think you still
    may find it usefull. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Obviously, any ideas for improvement are welcome.
